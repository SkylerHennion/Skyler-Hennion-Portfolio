        <h1>SKYLER HENNION</h1>
        <p>
          Skyler Hennion is a fifth-generation New Yorker majoring in Technical
          Theater at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and
          Performing Arts. Set to attend Vassar College in August 2025, she
          intends to pursue Sociolinguistics and Medieval & Renaissance Studies, as well as continuing her interests in theater and the creative arts. 
          
          <br /><br />
          From an early age, Skyler was introduced to the world of technical
          theater by her mom who worked in the field as a scenic
          artist. By third grade, she began her own career in technical theater
          for her elementary school, and continued through middle and high
          school. To date she has worked on fourteen productions. In her four
          years at Laguardia, she  concentrated in the building, patterning, designing, and fitting of costumes and garments. She enjoys working as a dresser during performances because of the interaction with the actors and the in-the-moment demands of live theater.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of school, Skyler works in a variety of mediums, including painting, drawing, crafting, embroidery, and digital art. She looks forward to expanding her arsonal of creative skills.
